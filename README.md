## Call Tracking Metrics Data Connector

This data connector provides access to your Call Tracking Metrics data in Google Data Studio. It interacts directly with the Call Tracking Metrics API to pull in your data. This connector is under continuous development and may change at any time.

### Usage
You will need an API Access Key and Secret Key from your Call Tracking Metrics Account as well as an Account ID to use with this connector. You will be prompted to enter this information when you make the connection.

Some data types will need to be modified to use effectively in reports. Google does not currently allow defining data types more specific than "NUMBER", "BOOLEAN" or "STRING". As such, geographies, dates, durations, etc. will be one of these generalized types and will need to be modified.
